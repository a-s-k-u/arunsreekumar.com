      {"id" :1,"timeAdded" : "","messageText": "Okay...first of all I loved this movie. Hard to place it in the right genre, but, is definitly a crime thriller.","fromUser": ""},
      {"id" :1,"timeAdded" : "","messageText": "So, let's start one by one. What do you think about the <b>plot</b> ?","fromUser": "ME"},
      {"id" :1,"timeAdded" : "","messageText": "The whole story is about how a psychology professor takes revenge on two police officers who destroyed his family. And he finds accomplice in two psychic guys.","fromUser": ""},
      {"id" :1,"timeAdded" : "","messageText": "But, was it necesary to stage a serial killing ? Would someone go that far, and take this insanely high risk lane ... just to cover up the motive ? ","fromUser": "ME"},
      {"id" :1,"timeAdded" : "","messageText": "Maybe it is the desire to torture his victims. That's where the story telling comes into the picture","fromUser": ""},
      {"id" :1,"timeAdded" : "","messageText": "Once you establish a personal tragedy and a real solid reason for his actions, what now matters to the audience is how the story unfolds. Logic takes a back seat now.","fromUser": ""},
      {"id" :1,"timeAdded" : "","messageText": "Logic like, </br> 1.) this blind artist draws the portrait of his unknown customer from descriptions given by his daughter. Why the hell he didn't do that for his previous customers, whom he saw with his own eyes.","fromUser": ""},
      {"id" :1,"timeAdded" : "","messageText": "2.) So this villain team consists of a Psychology Professor, two pyschos and one drug dealer. Okay, then, who the hell hacked the CCTV Recordings? Essentially none of them are IT experts.","fromUser": ""},
      {"id" :1,"timeAdded" : "","messageText": "Oh! maybe coz the main theme is still serial killing. But, it's a lot less scary than <a style='color:#99ccff' href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7060344/'>Raatchasan</a>, coz the villian in this movie is not actually psychic. Poor guy is just taking his revenge.","fromUser": ""},
      {"id" :1,"timeAdded" : "","messageText": "Unfortunatly, two of his targets were police officers, so, he had to do a bit more work than the usual serial killers from other movies, like, hyptonitising them first, hacking into police network to cover his tracks etc","fromUser": ""},
