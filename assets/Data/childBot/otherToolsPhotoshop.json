The rest is from Premium (users paying to hide ads) and licensing a self-hosted version of Photopea.When you start your own project, you never know, if it will ever make $250k a year. But if you get hired, you can be quite sure, that you will never make more than $250k a year.Follow Photopea to see my progress :) http://facebook.com/photopea , http://twitter.com/photopeacom </p>","fromUser": "full"}
